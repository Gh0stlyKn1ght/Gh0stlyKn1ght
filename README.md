# **👤 About **

I’m **Gh0stlyKn1ght** — an engineering, cybersecurity, and software-focused educator who brings real-world tech and modern industry practices into the classroom. I’m new to the robotics world, but I come from a background in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, networking, and web application security, and I teach robotics the same way security engineers work: build, test, break, understand, improve.

I focus on hands-on engineering, digital fabrication, microcontrollers, web tech, and competitive robotics to push students beyond worksheets and into real-world problem-solving. I don’t believe in “follow the instructions” engineering—I want students learning how the systems work and why.

My teaching blends robotics, electronics, cybersecurity fundamentals, and software design using platforms like Arduino, VEXcode, Tinkercad, Khan Academy, and Code.org. My goal is to give students practical, transferable skills that lead into modern tech careers—not outdated curriculum.

I also serve as the Head Coach and lead mentor for a high school FIRST Robotics Competition team, where I’m building the team’s engineering process, documentation systems, technical workflows, and competitive robotics foundation. I focus on creating a student-driven engineering culture—one that encourages experimentation, design thinking, safety, and professional engineering habits.

My background is in cybersecurity and web application security, and I bring that mindset into robotics and engineering instruction: understanding how systems fail, how to troubleshoot them, and how to build better technology because of it.

When I’m not teaching or building, I’m deep into cinema—especially Japanese film, New Wave movements, cyberpunk aesthetics, and 35mm film restoration.

I also develop my own tools—DeepSniff, Gh0stlyFi, and other projects that blend networking, visualization, and security analysis. I’m committed to building learning environments where students actually engineer, innovate, and experiment—not just study theory.
