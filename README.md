#### Don't know where I'm headed, just a digital head .

# **👤 About **

I’m **Gh0stlyKn1ght**, a Computer Science, Engineering, and Robotics educator who turns classrooms into real-world innovation labs. I teach with a blend of industry-driven STEM practice, cyberpunk creativity, and no-nonsense technical skill—preparing students to think, build, break, fix, and engineer like professionals.

My work bridges **electronics, robotics, cybersecurity, sustainable engineering, and design thinking**, using hands-on learning, competitive robotics, and digital fabrication to push students beyond worksheets and into real problem-solving. Whether it’s VEX robotics, microcontrollers, CAD modeling, Wi-Fi engineering, ethical hacking, or web security, I make sure every project connects to actual modern tech careers.

I build full-year learning paths that integrate platforms like **Tinkercad, VEXcode, Arduino, Khan Academy, and Code.org**, bringing accessible and future-focused STEM education to every learner.

Outside the classroom, I spend my time **mentoring young builders, hackers, and creators**, helping them level up in robotics, cybersecurity, engineering, and technical problem-solving. My specialty is **web application security and ethical hacking**—breaking systems down, understanding how and why they fail, and teaching students how to build smarter, safer technology.

When I’m not engineering or teaching, I’m deep into cinema—especially **French New Wave, Czech New Wave, Japanese cinema, cyberpunk aesthetics**, and **35mm film scan restorations**.

I also build and maintain my own tools, including **DeepSniff**, **Gh0stlyFi**, and a growing archive of cybersecurity and OSINT resources—all designed to make complex concepts easier to understand and more engaging to learn.

My teaching philosophy is simple:
**“Smarter, not harder. ”**
My Favorite qoute is: 
***"HACK THE PLANET!"***
